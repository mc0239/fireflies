# Fireflies

_Fireflies_ is an interactive visualization project in which the user can manipulate the movement of boids (fireflies) by shining with colorful lights.

## Running the project

### Visualization

To run the visualization (assuming under Windows):

```bash
cd java-visualization/
gradlew.bat build
gradlew.bat run
```

Note: interaction with the visualization is possible by holding the left or right mouse button. It's also possible to make a screenshot with `P` key and exit the visualization by pressing `ESC`.

### Marker detection

To run ArUco marker detection (assuming python 3 installed):

```
cd python-detect/
python detect.py
```

Visualization and detection processes are running independently of each other (i.e. you can run visualization without the detection).
Processes communicate between each other using a web socket, which opens on port 12001.

## Future work

If one was to build upon this project, there's a couple of things that should be resolved first (a list of TODOs):

- Python detect script does not terminate propery (stops than hangs).
- Visualization breaks on window resize (wrapping around borders and light source positions do not work properly)
- Light source changes and lightness rework (increase is done on socket receive, decrease is done every update cycle)
- Make visualization parameters external (i.e. settable via input arguments) such as number of boids, drawing threshold, maximum boid speed and force, parameters of the flocking, etc.
- Better define and document the communication between the detection and visualization processes.
